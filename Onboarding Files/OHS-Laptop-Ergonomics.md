# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

## Risks of using a Laptop without an external monitor or keyboard

Working on your Laptop without an external monitor or keyboard poses different ergonomic and inefficiency related risk. This risk may lead to body fatigue, which also leads to reduced productivity and your comfort while doing your task, and lastly, you are limited to your multitasking capability in your workspace. Therefore, you need to have an external monitor to provide comfort and ease of use while doing your task. As for the keyboard, you must position it so that it doesn't cause physical strain to you.

## Ergonomic Equipment

There is a lot of equipment that you can utilize to improve your posture and efficiently improve your workflow. First equipment that I suggest is the Laptop Stand, which elevates your laptop so that your neck is properly angled, which reduces its strain. Another piece of equipment is the suggestion on the previous question, which is an external monitor and keyboard. This also improves your posture, which reduces strain from your wrist, neck, and shoulders. Lastly, you can also have an ergonomic chair that can provide lumbar support and proper alignment.

## Workspace Adjustments

In order to provide efficient and seamless activity in your workspace, key adjustments to the different components in your workspace are needed. First adjustment is your Monitor Height, where it must be below your eye level, with the center of the screen slightly on a downward angle.  Next, you can adjust your Chair Position so your feet are flat on the floor or the footrest. You must be able to sit fully back in the chair to support your back. Lastly, for the desk, you must set its height so your elbows are at 90 degrees when typing. 

## Daily Habits 

In order to reduce prolonged time on the laptop this are the following habits that you must do, which is the 20-20-20 Rule, where every 20 minutes you must look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to relax your eye focus. You can also use the Focus Bear app to help you reduce your screen time and even improve your workflow. Laslty adjust your display settings so that it doesn't strain your eyes. 

# Reflection

Equipment changes that I must make are adding an external monitor and having a new chair that supports my back properly. Also adding a laptop stand where I can elevate my laptop and make my work efficient.

Adjusting the brightness of the screen is one thing for sure, and I take regular breaks while doing my work. The following behavioral changes will improve not only my workflow but also my efficiency in working on the task.

Obviously number one suggestion is the Focus Bear app since it has the ability to remind you to keep your posture and maintain it. The app also suggests you take a rest and stretch your body to reduce strain.
