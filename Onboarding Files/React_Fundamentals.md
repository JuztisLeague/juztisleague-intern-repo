# Working with Lists & User Input

What are some common issues when working with lists in React?
Common issues that you encounter working with lists in React are using index as your key, having no key at all, using non-unique keys, and poor performance of large lists. As for Index as your Key, it can lead to performance problems and unexpected behavior when the list order changes, or items are added or removed. As for no Key it causes a warning to have a key on each child in a list. You must also use unique identifiers in order for React to correctly track the list of items, and lastly, rendering thousands of list items at once can slow you application.
