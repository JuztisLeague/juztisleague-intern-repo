# Use of AI Tools

## AI Tools for Mobile Application Development

The AI Tools that you can utilize while doing Mobile Application Development are AI-native coding platforms, AI-powered no-code builders, AI Coding assistants, and Large Language Models. The following AI tools help me as an intern to explain and understand the code or languages being used in the development of the Mobile App in Focus Bear.

## Benefits and Risks of AI Tools in a Professional Setting

The benefits of using AI tools are that it enhances your Efficiency and productivity in completing tasks. This also gives you an efficient way of handling your day in reading your emails, scheduling your day, and managing your data. Another benefit is improving your decision-making. This helps users to make proper decisions by analyzing large datasets to uncover patterns and generate data-driven insights. For the risk of AI tools, one is Data Privacy and Security Risks, due to the AI handling large volumes of sensitive data, which increases the risk of data breaches. Another is the most common problem, and it is rampant, which is the over-reliance and loss of human judgment in using AI.

## Types of Information that are not for AI Tools

The type of information that should not be shared in AI Tools is your Personal Information Data, Financial and Banking Information, Password, and Login Credentials. The following information must not be shared because these details are confidential and can lead to data breaches in the company.

## Fact-check and Validate AI-generated content

To fact-check and validate AI-generated content, you must prompt the sources and verify the citations to the AI Tool that you use. This helps you to identify if the content is factual and is based on different studies. Another is to cross-reference the AI content with trusted sources. This would help you understand more about the topic and differentiate the factual content and fake content given by your AI tool.

# Reflection

When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
You can use AI for assistance to help you understand the information, or turn the AI into a tutor to help you understand codes that you take time to understand. Rely on your own skills by differentiating the reliability of the information from the AI, and also, before you resort to AI, you must try to build and understand it first by yourself.

As I said in the first paragraph, you must try the problem first by yourself and research for solutions online, then, when you hit a wall and still can't solve it. It is right then and there to ask for help from AI, and also turn your AI into a tutor or teacher, and make sure that it won't spoon-feed suggestions to you.

The steps that I must take are to limit the data I prompt to the AI tools. I can limit it by not sending personal information, banking information, or even passwords or login credentials. These are data that are private and must not be shared, even with the AI tools, since this can lead to a data breach and also a possible vulnerability to the company.
