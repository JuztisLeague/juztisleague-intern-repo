# Professionalism at Focus Bear

## Professional Behavior vs. Unprofessional Behavior

 One way to communicate professionally with your peers in the company is to have a clear and respectful language in emails and messages. You must respond promptly to the emails and messages where you must give acknowledgments to the people you talk to.  An unprofessional way of communicating is sending emails with typos, inappropriate tone, and excessive use of emojis, and responding to emails over a long period of time.

For professional meeting etiquette, you must arrive on time or maybe even earlier than the scheduled time in order to respect other people's schedules. You must observe the meeting, and you provide contributions to the discussions. As for the unprofessional meeting etiquette, you arrive late to the meeting, and you just don't care about the meeting, giving no proper contribution to the team during the meeting.

## Respectful Communication

It is a way of communicating with your peers with politeness, clarity, and empathy, especially in remote team settings. The tone in messages must start with a polite, constructive, and non-confrontational tone, with this you can engage with your peers in the company with respect and receive the respect back to them as well. In handling disagreement, be open to the issue that is being brought up, be understanding on both sides of the coin in dealing with arguments, especially when we are in a remote setting. In giving or responding to feedback, it must be specific and professionally constructed, and be on time in responding to the email.

## Give and Receive Feedback Professionally

In order to give feedback professionally, you must be specific on the topic and be respectful in how you construct the email. The tone must be respectful and polite in order for the receiver not to take your message the wrong way. The feedback must be straight to the point and make it easy to understand for the receiver of your email. As for receiving the feedback in this way you must reply to the sender that you have received the email and conduct the necessary task being sent to you. You must reply as soon as possible so that the sender will get a heads-up that you received the feedback.

# Reflection

Yes, I do have experience or have witnessed great teamwork and professionalism. It was effective due to the ability to understand each other's capabilities, the team also shared the strong ability to communicate every problem encountered, and having arguments always led to the problem being fixed because we handled each of the problems professionally and properly.

First step you must do to have clear communication and be respectful to other people is to introduce yourself and set the tone of your message properly.  You must acknowledge their status and respectfully construct a message that is easy and quick to understand by other people.

To make a positive, fun, and professional work environment, it is essential to make it open to everyone. People around that environment must be able to express themselves, and they must be heard and understood as well. In that way, people tend to understand other people and respect them as well, also everything is always fun; you must also build rules and regulations which limits to the way people have fun not reaching the limit of hurting other people.  

To prepare for an effective meeting, you must set the topic or set the agenda for the meeting and then communicate with the people around the meeting to provide suggestions on the meeting to achieve a proper goal. You must be able to collaborate properly with the people around the meeting and must let other people talk in order to have fairness and professionalism.

Actually, to be proactive during my internship, I would like to seek out activities or tasks that are related to my applied program in order for me to learn and improve my skills. No matter if it is beginner, medium, or hard level, I will do it even if it takes me a long time to do it. I would also seek problems around the company that needs of solving, especially on the application side of things in Focus Bear.

To follow up with my colleagues or supervisors, I must respectfully construct a message or email that would quickly convey the information directly. I must acknowledge them properly and politely ask for the needed information or action coming from them. If they don't respond directly, I would rather wait for a day, and then if they don't respond, I will send another email about the needed information; however, this would also include a message that shows the needed deadline of the work in order for the receiver to realize that the information is needed.

The thing that I won't do is to send emails consistently without understanding the other people's point of view. Also, construct a message that is disrespectful for the receiver to be read. I must also create an email that is hard to understand for the receiver of the email.
