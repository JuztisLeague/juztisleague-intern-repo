# Roles in an Agile Team

## Key Roles in an Agile Team

Here are the following Key Roles in an Agile Team:
**Developers** - This group is responsible for building the application, and in an Agile Team, these people are those who provide updates on the ongoing development of the application and what are the problems encountered by them.

**QA (Quality Assurance)**  - This group is those people who update the quality of the design and execution of the application. These people gave the following bugs and problems that they have noticed from the testing they conducted on the application.

**Product Manager (PM)** - This person is responsible for the strategy, roadmap, and prioritization. These people are responsible for the possible updates of the things to be done during the week for the whole team.

**Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)** -  This group is responsible on aligning the team's goals and objectives in order to achieve the final product of your application. This also facilitates communication between the two teams in order to have a clear understanding of the creation of the product.

**Other supporting roles** - For other supporting roles, they update the necessary things that can be a problem or achievements they have made for the day, for the team to recognize the possible changes to the schedule of the week.

## Kanban vs. Scrum

For the Kanban, it does not prescribe specific roles, and this allows teams to maintain existing structures. For this one, the collaboration is more fluid and continuous, driven by the Kanban board's visual workflow and work-in-progress limits. The other team members can help each other across tasks to maintain flow, and leadership emerges organically.

Scrum relies on three defined roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team with distinct responsibilities. I already explained their roles before; however, these roles have specific functionality, and during collaboration, it is through structured events like Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, and Retrospectives.

# Reflection

My role is an Intern for the Mobile Application Development, and this role can contribute to the Developer side of the Agile Process. During the Agile process, my role is to update the development of the Mobile Application and update the problems encountered as well.

How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
My responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles since we provide the development of the application itself, the QA handles the necessary bugs or flaws found in our development, which goes hand in hand in order to achieve the best user experience for our application.
