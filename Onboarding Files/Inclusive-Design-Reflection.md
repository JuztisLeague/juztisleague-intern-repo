# Working with Vulnerable Populations

## Vulnerable Populations

People who are part of vulnerable populations are those who are low-income individuals, older adults, and racial and ethnic minorities. These people or groups are more susceptible to digital exclusion due to intersecting social, economic, and structural disadvantages. The challenges they usually face in the digital space are limited access to internet connectivity, devices, and affordable services. Another challenge is the low digital literacy, which shows the lack of skills in navigating through online platforms effectively, and lastly, safety and privacy risk.

## Ethical Consideration

When designing a website or application for a neurodivergent individual must be ethically considerate in the creation of the application. One way of doing this is to avoid sensory overload, which you must minimize the visual, auditory, and tactile triggers such as flashing animations, loud sounds, or cluttered layouts. Another suggestion is to ensure clear and respectful communication, where you must use simple and direct language without jargon, which provides clarity of the words and phrases being used. Lastly, the person using the application has the capability to customize and edit the application from the font size, color themes, navigation paths, and interaction methods.

## Accessible Content and Interaction

The use of simple language and clear instructions is your foundation for accessibility. In short, you must make it simple for them to quickly understand your information being portrayed. Be consistent with the UI/UX design in order for the users to navigate the application quickly and efficiently.  Lastly, you must support focus and task completion, which shows the progress of the user, which is what the Focus Bear was intended to do.

## Support Neurodivergent Individuals

In order to support neurodivergent individuals in the workspace, you must use clear communication, which involves using direct and specific language. Another way is to respect for there different working styles, which is to recognize those people of there unique way of adapting to the workspace. Lastly is to be flexible, which means to find a way to suit there strength and provide a quiet and sensory-friendly workspace.

# Reflection

I will adjust the way I communicate with my fellow neurodivergent users or teammates by constructing my phrases more simply and clearly. I must be able to construct my words to help them understand quickly.

So far, since I use the Focus Bear app, everything has been easier to use; however, there are some things you need to discover on your own. Maybe a suggestion to have a user manual for the users in order to get the ropes on using the app. The app is a little bit complicated to use as of now.

Well, here in the Philippines, we do have a lot of vulnerable populations, and one solution that I may suggest is the knowledge that those people need in the rise of technology, bringing awareness to those people, and helping them give a career path for their future to be bright.
