# Set Up AI Tools for Development

I have tried all three for doing the necessary tasks in coding or understanding things as well. This also helped me in coding before I was an intern at Focus Bear.

For me, in terms of coding, the best AI tool is ChatGPT and Claude. I haven't really dived into GitHub Copilot that often. I can say that they helped me very much in terms of understanding the code or even generating a specific code.

A useful way to use AI in Coding is when you don't understand the code, or maybe the information coming from your supervisor is not understandable. You can also use AI if there is some code syntax you haven't fully understood yet, and it is important for the development of your application.
