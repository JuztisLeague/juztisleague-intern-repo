# Learning Goals during Focus Bear Intership

## Reflection

I hope to learn a lot in this internship, not just by developing a mobile application but also help other people as well. I also hope to improve my self ion delivering updates or information so that my peers will be able to understand quickly. Also, giving my 100% in order to land a job once I am finished with my hours in this internship.

The skills I want to develop are the ability to properly structure my code and the ability to be confident in explaining the following improvements I have made. I also want to

I can contribute to the team by showing my skills or giving ideas that can improve the application for mobile or web. I can contribute to troubleshooting or even quality testing the application to see if it is suited for the users to use.

I have the ability to code; however, I am not confident in my skills to code due to a lack of practice and because I get easily bored as well. However, I am trying to bring back my passion through this internship, and hopefully I can contribute to the company.

Success is that I have learned a lot and use those learnings in applying for a job, and I can also achieve this by landing a spot in Focus Bear. Either way, I am happy to be part of Focus Bear, and I want to use my learnings to improve myself.
