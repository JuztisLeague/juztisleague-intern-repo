## Best Practices of Handling Confidential Data

The first and best way of handling confidential data starts at the company, which is the employees who must be trained and aware of the different ways a hacker can get into the company's system.  Another one is securing the data sharing, which you must not share confidential data in emails that you don't recognize. Lastly is the Data Protection Policies, which enforce the policies of data confidentiality of the users of your company.

## Respond to Suspected Data Breach

To respond to a Suspected Data Breach, you must tell your supervisor or report it to the people in charge of handling the cybersecurity department. Incases like this, you must not hide it or solve the problem by yourself. You must be honest to report if breaches or accidental disclosure of confidential data are made.

# Reflection

For me to ensure I handle data securely, is to always check the email account properly. Another is to never share direct data with someone not working in the company.  I must observe my email and check the integrity of the email account that is being used. If an unknown email pops up that can harm the company, you must report it so that the account can be reviewed and report it.

To dispose of sensitive information safely, only do it to the people of the company since this type of information is not for the public. Disposing of it in the open can't be done, as a part of Focus Bear, I must be vigilant in disclosing data, and only to the people in Focus Bear I should disclose it.

Common mistakes are sending an email to an unknown email account, especially impersonating one of your supervisors. In order to avoid this, be observant of the email account sending the email, don't directly assume that the email you receive is coming from the people in your company. Another is people sharing their passwords with other people, and mostly have the same password for almost all accounts they have. To reduce this problem, have a password manager and don't share your password with anyone.
