# Introduction to Redux Toolkit (State Management)

You will use useState when the state is local, which means you're using it for form inputs, toggle buttons, modal open/close, and UI state. As a rule, Redux is needed when the state is global, meaning that many components across the app need the same data, such as user login info, authentication tokens, or notifications.

# Using Selectors in Redux Toolkit

The benefits of using the selector is it improves code readability, protects your app from future state changes, it has reusable multiple components, and allows for performance optimization. Selectors provide a clean and reusable way to access Redux state, which also allows developers to separate state logic from UI logic, making code easier to manage and debug.
