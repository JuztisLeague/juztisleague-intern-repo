# Working in an Agile Team

## Agile

Agile is a meeting process that conducts a flexible project management approach that delivers work in small, incremental cycles called sprints. This emphasizes continuous collaboration, rapid feedback, adaptability to change, and delivering working software early and often. The key difference between agile and traditional project management is that the approach to planning is different in agile; it uses iterative and incremental development. Also, it employs adaptive and continuous planning. This helps clear and processed improvement of your product.

## Core Values and Principles of Agile

The Agile process has core values and principles. So the Agile Manifesto has 4 core values. The following are the core values:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

1. Satisfy the Customer
2. Welcome Changing Requirements
3. Deliver Working Software frequently
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals

## Differences between Scrum and Kanban

The scrum framework uses fixed-length sprints (1-4 weeks) with a defined start and end. Planning occurs at the start of each sprint, and changes are generally not allowed during the sprint. They also have roles, which are Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team.

For the Kanban, it emphasizes continuous flow, and as soon as capacity allows, with no time-boxed cycles. Planning occurs just in time, and changes can be made anytime, making it ideal for dynamic or urgent tasks. There are no prescribed roles that show self-organizing, and responsibilities are shared among members.

## Focus Bear on Kanban

Focus Bear uses the Kanban method in the Agile framework due to the style of work we have. Different employees coming from different countries are favorable to have a continuous way of collaboration in order to make faster change of schedule. Since Kanban can change the schedule anytime, it is flexible for the different employees in Focus Bear.

# Reflection

The biggest benefits of Agile is the ability to keep aligning to the necessary goals and objectives in order to achieve the product. It also has a detailed plan to see the schedule of necessary tasks; however, the downside is that you need to finish the tasks on the scheduled dates to achieve your monthly goals and objectives, since it can disrupt the flow of the Agile framework if one or two objectives don't align.

Agile principles help improve my role and responsibilities since this creates a better way of communication between different roles in the company. This is to align the goals and objectives with the product to achieve the necessary product.
