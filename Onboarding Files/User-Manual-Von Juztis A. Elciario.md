# Creating Your "User Manual for Me"

# User Manual for Von Juztis A. Elciario

## My role

I am a Mobile Application Development Intern at Focus Bear that helps develop, improve, and maintain the mobile application of Focus Bear. I work Monday to Friday with a time of 6 - 8 hours a day, and with this time frame, my goal is to achieve 540 hours of my Internship and to earn a lot of points in this Internship program.

## How I Work Best

I do my best work depending on where I am. I can do my best work on my alone time, where I am just alone without my peers or workmates. I can also do my best work when I am with my peers and workmates because they are also the ones hyping me up and helping me. I do struggle if the environment is too toxic or too much pressure is being given to me; I tend to crumble fast. However, I am not afraid of pressured work as long as I am given time to do the necessary things.

## Communication Style

I prefer messages to be simple, direct, and clear, this give me the full understanding of the information quickly and efficiently. I prefer it simple and short since complex words would really take a hard time to understand. The best way to reach me is through my email **<vjelciario@gmail.com>** and through my Discord **@juztisleague**. If you need something urgent from me, you can call my number 09454331147 or call me via Discord.

## Collaboration & Teamwork

I work best in a team when everyone is participating and respectful to each other. My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is not participating or not giving ideas to the group. I prefer people to suggest and then select on those suggestions the best way for the task to be done. If I seem quiet in a meeting, this usually means that I am tired or I am trying to think of a suggestion to make the agenda solved or improved.

## Focus & Productivity

I stay focused by having a quiet and solemn workspace. Things that distract me are noises around the workspace that are unusual; however, music can make me productive as well. The best way to support my productivity is by acknowledging my improvements and giving me compliments.

## Feedback & Growth

I like feedback to be direct, gentle, and private. If it is good or bad feedback, I want it to be direct and gentle to help me accept the feedback wholeheartedly and easily. When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is to approach me and talk to me privately and be direct, gentle, and open with it. I appreciate it when teammates help me improve my skills and capabilities. I also want them to accept my flaws and respect me for who I am.

## Fun Facts & Quirks

One thing people often misunderstand about me is that I am shy; well, that is who I am at first, but once you get to know me more, I become a clingy person and a happy person to be with. Fun fact about me is that during 2020 on the time of COVID, I caught up to the latest episode in One Piece Anime in 4 months. My work superpower is that I am an optimistic person, I can always smile at you no matter what problem comes in our way.

# Research and Learn

## User Manual for Me

It is a manual that talks about yourself; this lets people know your strengths, weaknesses, habits, and hobbies. This manual gives other peers the ability to know you and to understand who you are. This manual, it also helps them to communicate with you in what way.

## Categories that are Helpful

The categories that will surely help in getting to know you more are Feedback & Growth, Focus & Productivity, and Collaboration & Teamwork. The three things I mentioned are important because they explain who you are in a workspace setting. This gives the full knowledge of your co-workers on how to collaborate and connect with you in specific task given.

## Improve Teamwork

Like I always say, this improves teamwork due to you categorizing the things that make you efficient in doing your task. This gives a heads up to the people around you on what are the things make you work properly and also give the best outcome in your given task.

# Reflection

I need my teammates to communicate directly with me and to provide detailed instructions. I am a person who needs a little more understanding of things, especially complex instructions. Another is to respect my space while doing the task, and also be open to answering my questions in times of my doubt in doing the task.

Since I am in an online setting, there are only two ways to conduct communication with me, and it is through async messages and video calls. If the information is complex, I would prefer having it in a video call so that Q and A portions can be asked directly, which makes it easy to understand.  As for simple information, I would prefer it as async messages, maybe through email or Discord.

The things that help me focus and be productive is one quiet workspace or music. It helps me stay focused on doing tasks and also gives me my own world to do my tasks properly and efficiently. Having a quiet workspace gives me peace and solitude to do my task properly, and as for music, it gives me the groove to do my task fun way.

For me, I prefer clear and direct feedback with positive reinforcement; I am the kind of person who gets hurt by feedback; however, it also gives me better motivation as well. Maybe a positive reinforcement may keep my drive burning to always do my best in task. I don't take it as an insult but as a motivation to improve my old version of myself.

Number one, I do need time to process ideas, and also I love to brainstorm as well; this can go hand in hand depending on the situation. No matter the situation, I can adapt to any person on how we collaborate on ideas to show a productive outcome.
