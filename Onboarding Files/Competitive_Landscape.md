# Compare Focus Bear with Other Productivity Apps
## Reflection

Focus Bear is different from the following apps that were researched due to its capability to encapsulate all the features in one application. The following features make Focus Bear unique from most applications: Block Distractions, Habit Building, Step-by-Step Routines, Automatic Focus Activation, and Behavior Change Focus. 

I would choose Focus Bear merely for its all-in-one system; instead of using different apps for different features, I would rather choose an application that can do everything in one system. Focus Bear also showcases a user-friendly environment for its application in order to provide ease of use for the users.

A feature that Focus Bear does not have is Community and Social Accountability; other apps have the ability to motivate you through social support and shared progress. Focus Bear would be amazing to have the ability to share your progress and let people motivate you to keep using the application.

One improvement for Focus Bear is to identify the weak points of the user. This will let the user realize what the things to avoid during the focus sessions are and what to improve during the focus sessions.
