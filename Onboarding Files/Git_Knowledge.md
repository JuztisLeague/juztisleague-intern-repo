# Git Setup & Document Your Knowledge

I had used Git before in copying a repository to my local computer. I also used Git in implementing our thesis during that semester, where using Git is a way to push and pull code that was changed during our implementations.

I chose the Git command-line interface using PowerShell in Windows Terminal as my Git client. This is because it provides full control over the Git operations, and it quickly helps me understand how Git works.

The most interesting thing I learned about Git is how it tracks changes through commits and allows version control of projects. This allows each commit to act as a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time, enabling you to review changes, track your progress, and revert to previous versions.
