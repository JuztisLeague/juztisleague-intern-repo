# Reflection

Security measures that I follow are first not to open websites that are not safe, not to open links that are suspicious, and to report emails that have possible phishing attacks. To improve this, I must have a blocker of suspicious sites and also be vigilant in checking emails.

Well, in order make it a habit, you need to practice it every day and make that practice a consistent routine in order for you to make it a habit. Making a habit to conduct security behavior is valid in order to safely protect your device and protect the data that is coming from the company.

The steps I would take to ensure my password and accounts are secure are to create a unique password that is not easily determined by other people. I would also use a different password for every account I have, and I will use a password manager to create passwords that can enhance the security of my accounts.

If ever I suspected of a security breach on my device or account, I quickly inform my supervisor and turn off my device and disconnect it from the internet. Next is to report the account or the website that can cause malware or phishing attacks.
