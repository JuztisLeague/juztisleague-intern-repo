# Identifying & Fixing Code Smells

Code smells that I find in my code are Magic Numbers & Strings, Long Functions, and Duplicate Code. As a coder or a developer, I do have tendencies and habits that show this code smells. I never really do it on purpose, but it's also my way to really understand the logic of the code. Once I have learned the logic, I then revise the code to something much more efficient and reliable. 

Well, refactoring improves the readability and maintainability of the code because it's now much simpler and easier to understand. If I stick to my habits in coding, other developers might not understand the program I created since it is long and inefficient in terms of run time. I do try my best to resolve these habits.

Code smells are a minor problem that can lead to a bigger issue once being seen later on. Avoiding is a way to improve debugging since minor coding problems have been taken away, which makes way for people to understand the code faster and easier. It is easy to debug since it is more uniform and consistent.
