# Company Overview & Reflection

Focus Bear was created in order to help people diagnosed with ADHD and ASD have an application with an anti-distraction and anti-burnout feature.  According to the CEO of Focus Bear, it is a tool that would force you to focus on your activity of the day instead of doom scrolling to TikTok, YouTube, or any other applications. 

The problem that Focus Bear is solving is the ability to stay focused and consistent on your day-to-day activities. A lot of people who are diagnosed with ADHD or college students get easily distracted, burnt out, or maybe depressed due to the inability to concentrate on the activities that they planned or needed to do. Focus Bear is there to solve this problem and teach a habit to the users to concentrate on the task given.

It is important because we are helping diagnosed patients to adapt to the world we live in. Some people see them differently or even discriminate; they must be able to adapt to the system. Through this controlled environment in the cyber world, this helps them to be productive or even improve themselves to become a better person.

Well, my number one value that I always follow is to help those people in need. I would gladly be able to help people from the audience or users of Focus Bear. I want to strive to have a mindset to focus on the needed task, and also be a person who wants to help people achieve their dreams as well. 

Yes, I do relate merely because the generation today is so easily distracted by TikTok or YouTube. Scrolling or browsing in those applications makes you lazy or even have an unproductive day due to just doom scrolling everyday and not doing anything. I also want to solve this type of issue I have, which is being so lazy. The problem is I recognized it, but the cycle still keeps on going on and on.
