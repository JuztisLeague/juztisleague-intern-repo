# Set Up a Terminal Client & Get Comfortable with the Command Line

The terminal client that I chose is Windows Terminal + PowerShell, which is because the terminal client is the default and most optimized terminal environment for Windows. It provides a modern interface with different useful features such as multiple tabs, customizable settings, and better readability. 

All I customized is the color scheme in order to make the text easier to read, and I could improve the way I use the terminal for long development sessions.

The most powerful command I learned today is git clone, which has the ability to create a copy of a remote repository on my local computer. It is also helpful because it helps me download project files, work on them locally, and contribute to the repository.
