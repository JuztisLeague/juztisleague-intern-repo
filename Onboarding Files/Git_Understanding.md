# Creating & Reviewing Pull Requests

Pull Request is really important, especially when you're in a workspace that is conducting remotely, and those people are from different places around the globe. This gives the ability to share and understand code properly from different people. They have the time to check and debug your code before combining it with the main code of the overall application. 

A well-structured PR is the ability to explain the necessary additions to the code you committed on GitHub. This means that a well-structured PR is easily understood and can properly merge with the main program without any problems. 

The PR is explained thoroughly, and the peers and mentors give feedback on the necessary changes you make to your PR to the main program. I understand that it is much easier for your peers, workmates, or supervisor to understand properly your PR in order to easily debug and realize your code additions.
