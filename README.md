# Focus Bear Internship Repositroy

I am Von Juztis A. Elciario, a Mobile Development Intern at Focus Bear. This repository contains my onboarding materials and activities for the Focus Bear Internship Program. Most of the base files and resources included here are provided by the Focus Bear team, while additional content and updates are contributions based on my own work and progress throughout the internship.

I will be doing this internship for 540 hours and doing this remotely. This means I will be doing this online and joining meetings through Google Meet or Discord. For more details about me contact me in <vjelciario@gmail.com> (Email) and @juztisleague (Discord).
